DEAR MS FRANK HOPE YOU HAD A GOOD WEEKEND THANK YOU FOR THE SAFETY DEPOSIT BOX ACCESS RECORDS YOU SENT THOUGH CAN I SUGGEST THAT IN THE FUTURE WE USE A HIGHER LEVEL OF SECURITY EVEN FAIRLY INEXPERIENCED CRIMINALS CAN BE FAMILIAR WITH THESE CIPHERS AND WE DONT KNOW WHO MIGHT BE MONITORING YOUR COMMUNICATION CHANNELS AS PROMISED I EXAMINED THE VAULT RECORDS IN DETAIL AND THEY DO TELL A STORY THOUGH I AM NOT SURE WHAT IT MEANS THERE IS A PATTERN IN THE NUMBERS THAT IS VERY SUGGESTIVE AND IF YOU CAN EXPEDITE MY REQUEST TO SPEND SOME TIME ALONE IN THE VAULT THEN I HOPE TO BE ABLE TO INVESTIGATE THAT FURTHER REEXAMINING THE VAULT CAMERA FOOTAGE THAT YOU SENT I WAS SURPRISED TO SEE THAT CULPEPER HAS NO ACTUAL FOOTAGE OF THE LOBBY OR VAULT ITSELF YOUR SECURITY TEAM EXPLAINED THAT THIS IS A PRIVACY POLICY TO ENSURE CLIENT CONFIDENTIALITY IT ALSO SEEMS TO BE THE CASE THAT WHILE CUSTOMERS SIGN IN AND OUT OF THE VAULT BANK STAFF ARE NOT REQUIRED TO DO SO THEY TOLD ME THAT STAFF DO NOT IN GENERAL ENTER THE INNER CHAMBER AND THAT NOONE SHOULD ENTER THE LOBBY UNACCOMPANIED WHILE THE VAULT IS UNLOCKED THE STAFF SAY THAT THIS PROTOCOL IS TAKEN VERY SERIOUSLY IT IS A SACKABLE OFFENSE TO ENTER THE LOBBY ALONE THERE IS ONE EXCEPTION IN ORDER TO ENSURE THE SECURITY OF THE COMBINATION THAT OPENS THE VAULT ITSELF THE CHIEF TELLER ENTERS THE LOBBY ALONE IN THE MORNING TO OPEN UP THE HEAD OF SECURITY WAITS OUTSIDE THEN CONDUCTS A SEARCH OF THE TELLER WHEN THEY LEAVE THE VAULT TO ENSURE THAT NOTHING HAS BEEN REMOVED THE FOOTAGE SHOWS THE PAT DOWN IN PROGRESS THAT DAY SO I THINK IT IS FAIR TO DEDUCE THAT IF THE TELLER HAD REMOVED ANYTHING FROM THE SAFE THEN IT WOULD HAVE BEEN DISCOVERED AT THE TIME THAT MEANS THAT IF ANYTHING WAS TAKEN FROM THE BOX THEN IT HAD ALREADY BEEN REMOVED WHEN THE TELLER AND THE SECURITY GUARD ARRIVED REGARDING THE PAPER LINING IN THE DEPOSIT BOX LID I ASKED THE BANK STAFF ABOUT IT AND THE CHIEF TELLER WHO IS A MANDARIN SPEAKER RECOGNISED THE CHARACTERS AS THE DIGITS ZERO AND ONE SHE SUGGESTED THAT THE THREE LINES COULD DENOTE THE NUMBERS FIVE FOUR THREE IN BINARY THOUGH OTHER READINGS ARE POSSIBLE IF THEY WERE WRITTEN CLASSICALLY FOR EXAMPLE TO BE READ VERTICALLY RIGHT TO LEFT THEN THEY COULD DENOTE SIX ONE FIVE I WONDERED IF THIS REFERRED TO THE BOX NUMBER AS THERE ARE SEVEN HUNDRED AND SIXTYTHREE BOXES IN THE VAULT BUT THE BOX ITSELF WAS APPARENTLY TAKEN FROM CASSETTE TWENTY THREE SO UNLESS IT HAS BEEN PUT BACK IN THE WRONG PLACE SOME TIME THEN I DONT THINK THAT CAN BE IT PERHAPS SOMEONE AT THE BANK MIGHT HAVE AN IDEA LET ME KNOW WHEN YOU HAVE ARRANGED THE VAULT ACCESS FOR ME YOURS SINCERELY JADE CIFRAR
JODIE IS MAKING THIS VERY EASY FOR ME HER RECENT CASE NOTES WERE LEFT ON AN ENCRYPTED USB KEY ATTACHED TO HER KEY CHAIN I HAD TAKEN THE SUITE OPPOSITE AND REVERSED THE SPYHOLE IN MY DOOR SO I COULD WATCH HER MOVEMENTS I THOUGHT I HAD BEEN CAREFUL BUT I SWEAR THATS HE GLANCED OVER AT ME AS SHE LOCKED THE DOOR TO HER ROOM THEN SHE WALKED AWAY DOWN THE CORRIDOR LEAVING THE KEYS IN THE LOCK I WONDERED IF I SHOULD CALL OUT TO HER BUT PERHAPS SHE WAS CHECKING THAT I WAS NOT THERE BEFORE LEAVING THE KEYS RATHER THAN TRYING TO  MAKE SURE I WAS UNTIL I CAN BE CERTAIN THAT SHE IS REACHING OUT I WILL HAVE TO BE DISCREET THE ENCRYPTION ON THE USB IS EASY TO BREAK USING A SIMPLE KEYWORD SUBSTITUTION IT CONTAINS JUST ONE FILE WITH NOTES ON HER INVESTIGATION AND SHE HAS CHANNELLED HER INNER SHERLOCK ELIMINATING THE IMPOSSIBLE TO ARRIVE AT THE ONLY LOGICAL CONCLUSION IN SHORT SOMEONE HAS A SECRET AND SOMEONE ELSE THE CHIEF TELLER WANTS TO KNOW WHAT IT IS THEY THINK JODIE CAN ASSIST AND MAYBE JODIE IS TRYING TO TELL ME ABOUT IT I DONT KNOW IF THAT IS BECAUSE SHE THINKS SHE NEEDS MY HELP I AM PRETTY SURE SHE DOESNT OR IF SHE THINKS I NEED TO KNOW ABOUT IT BUT UNTIL WE CAN FIND AWAY TO REESTABLISH TRUST IT IS GOING TO BE DIFFICULT TO FIND OUT WHICH
NOTES ON THE INVESTIGATION THE CHIEF TELLER ENTERED THE VAULT ACCOMPANIED BY THE HEAD OF SECURITY THE NIGHT BEFORE THE INCIDENT TO CHECK THAT THE DEPOSIT BOXES WERE SECURE AND TO LOCK THE VAULT DOOR ALL WAS IN ORDER AT THAT STAGE THE SECURITY FOOTAGE SHOWS THAT NOONE AND NOTHING LEFT THE VAULT OVERNIGHT THE CAMERAS WERE MONITORED LIVE FROM A REMOTE LOCATION AND I HAVE REVIEWED THE FOOTAGE MYSELF AFTER THE TELLER LEFT THE VAULT TO RAISE THE ALARMS HE AND THE SECURITY GUARD WERE ON CAMERA UNTIL ADDITIONAL SECURITY ARRIVED AND NEITHER OF THEM HAD ANYTHING IN THEIR POSSESSION THAT THEY COULD NOT ACCOUNT FOR THE DEPOSIT BOXES ARE ALL EMPTY EXCEPT THAT THEY EACH CONTAIN A PAPER LINING IN THE LID MARKED WITH NINE CHINESE CHARACTERS REPRESENTING THE DIGITS ONE AND ZERO SOME WITH THE GRID INSIDE AN OUTLINE AND SOME WITHOUT THE MARKINGS ARE UNIQUE TO EACH BOX CONCLUSION THE BANK VAULT WAS SECURE UNTIL OPENED IN THE MORNING AND NOTHING WAS REMOVED IN THAT PERIOD SO WE CAN RULE OUT THEFT AS A MOTIVE FOR THE BREAK IN THE ONLY PERSON WHO COULD HAVE DISTURBED THE VAULT CONTENTS WAS THE CHIEF TELLER BUT SHE NOT ONLY FAILED TO CONCEAL THE DISTURBANCE SHE ALSO NOTIFIED SECURITY ABOUT IT CLEARLY SHE WANTED AN INVESTIGATION BUT DID NOT WANT THE POLICE INVOLVED I WAS BROUGHT IN AT GREAT EXPENSE EVEN THOUGH CULPEPER ALREADY EMPLOYS ITS OWN SECURITY AND INVESTIGATION TEAM WHICH HAS MANY OF THE SAME SKILLS AS I DO THERE IS PERHAPS JUST ONE THING I CAN DO BETTER THAN THEM AND THAT IS TO BREAK CODES AND CIPHERS MAYBE THAT IS WHY I AM HERE I BELIEVE THAT THE CHIEF TELLER DELIBERATELY STAGED THE BREAK IN TO HOOK ME SO I COULD DISCOVER AND BREAK A CODE HIDDEN IN THE VAULT WHAT I DONT YET KNOW IS WHY I DONT TRUST THE CHIEF TELLER THOUGH I DONT KNOW WHAT SHE IS UP TO AND I AM NOT SURE THAT I CAN TRUST LYNN FRANK BUT ASSUMING THAT I AM RIGHT THEY NEED ME MORE THAN I NEED THEM SO I SHOULD BE SAFE FOR NOW WHILE I FOCUS ON THE CULPEPER CODE
I COULD GET USED TO THE HIGH CLASS HOTEL LIFE BUT I COULD NEVER GET USED TO PAYING FOR IT SO I THOUGHT IT WAS A LITTLE TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE WHEN I FOUND THE SUITE OPPOSITE TO JODIE UNOCCUPIED AND UNLOCKED I DIDNT EXPECT TO BE ABLE TO STAY HERE UNDETECTED FOR VERY LONG AND WAS PLANNING MY NEXT MOVE WHEN THE BELL HOP ARRIVED WITH A HOT MEAL AND A NOTE HOTELS DONT USUALLY FEED YOU BEFORE THROWING YOU OUT SO THIS WAS PROBABLY JUST A MISTAKEN ROOM NUMBER BUT I DIDNT WANT TO DRAW MORE ATTENTION TO MYSELF THAN I HAD TO SO I PAID A TIP FIFTEEN PERCENT ANYMORE OR LESS WOULD BE MEMORABLE AND SAT DOWN TO ENJOY IT I DIDNT NOTICE THAT THE NOTE REALLY WAS ADDRESSED TO ME UNTIL I HAD FINISHED JUST ONE WORD ON THE ENVELOPE BOSS AT FIRST GLANCE I ASSUMED I HAD BEEN TRACKED DOWN BY MY SUPERIORS AND THAT THIS WAS MY RECALL BUT JUST AS HOTELS DONT FEED DEAD BEATS SPY CHIEFS DONT PAY FOR ROOM SERVICE IN PLACES LIKE THIS SO THAT HAD TO BE WRONG I SHOULD HAVE RECOGNISED THE HANDWRITING THE NOTE WAS FROM JODIE AND AS WE HAD GUESSED SHE KNEW I WAS HERE IT DIDNT SAY MUCH APART FROM THAT BUT I GUESS SHE MIGHT SAY MORE AT DINNER

HARRY DIDNT SHOW UP AT OUR RENDEZVOUS AND HE DIDNT LEAVE A MESSAGE EITHER THAT WAS NO REASON TO PANIC HES A BIG BOY AND CAN  TAKE CARE OF HIMSELF IN ANY CASE I HAD PLENTY OF OTHER REASONS TO PANIC THE  REALISATION THAT TALLMADGE WAS WORKING FOR THE CIA CHANGED EVERYTHING FIRST IT MEANT THAT WE HAD STUMBLED ON SOMETHING MUCH BIGGER THAN A BANK FRAUD AND SECOND IT MEANT THAT THERE WAS A SERIOUS RISK I WOULD BE TAKEN IN I STILL WASNT ENTIRELY SURE WHY HARRY HAD COME BUT AFTER THE LAST FEW DAYS I HAD REASSURED MYSELF THAT HE WASNT ABOUT TO TURN ME IN I STILL HADNT EXPLAINED MY REASONS FOR ABSCONDING PERHAPS PARTLY BECAUSE I WASNT SURE OF THEM MYSELF BUT IT WAS CLEAR THAT HARRY WAS HERE BECAUSE HE WANTED TO UNDERSTAND NOT BECAUSE HE WANTED TO TURN ME IN OUR COUSINS IN THE AGENCY WERE UNLIKELY TO BE THAT SYMPATHETIC THAT WAS ASSUMING THEY KNEW I WAS ON THE RUN OF COURSE HARRY HAD NOT BEEN CLEAR ABOUT THAT SO THERE WAS STILL A CHANCE THAT I COULD FLY UNDER THEIR RADAR BUT NOT IF I WAS CAUGHT SNOOPING ON ONE OF THEIR OWN AS FOR TALLMADGE THERE WERE TWO POSSIBILITIES HE MIGHT BE ON THE LEVEL AND MAYBE THE KIDNAP AND INTIMIDATION WERE ALL PART OF AN OPERATION IT WAS ROUGHER THAN ANYTHING BOSS WOULD DO BUT THE AMERICANS HAVE DIFFERENT TRADITIONS ON THE OTHER HAND THE CIA DONT USUALLY GET TO INVESTIGATE US CITIZENS THAT IS THE PROVINCE OF THE FBI AND HOMELAND SECURITY SO EITHER THERE IS A LINK BETWEEN ANNA LYNN AND A FOREIGN POWER OR TALLMADGE WAS RUNNING A DISTINCTLY DODGY OPERATION THE OTHER POSSIBILITY IS THAT TALLMADGE IS RUNNING SOMETHING OFF BOOKS MAYBE AS A DOUBLE AGENT OR POSSIBLY AS A SIDE HUSTLE NEITHER IS ATTRACTIVE AND EITHER WAY HE WOULDNT THANK US FOR GETTING INVOLVED IT IS TEMPTING TO TRY TO HACK INTO THE LANGLEY SERVERS TO FIND OUT MORE ABOUT TALLMADGE BUT THE NAME WAS CLEARLY A COVER AND A SEARCH WOULD TRIGGER ALL SORTS OF ALARMS INSTEAD I SPENT A WHILE RESEARCHING THE NAME TO SEE IF IT SUGGESTED THE NATURE OF HIS OPERATION I THINK IT MUST JUST BE A COINCIDENCE THAT THE NAME ANNA SMITH TURNED UP IN THE HISTORY BOOKS LINKED WITH IT ITS A FAIRLY COMMON NAME BUT I WONDER IF ANNA HAD SEEN IT WHEN SHE DID HER OWN CHECKS ON TALLMADGE IF SO IT MIGHT HAVE SPARKED A DEEPER INTEREST AND MAYBE THAT WAS ENOUGH TO LEAD US HERE I HOPE TO GET A CHANCE TO ASK HER THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY ANNA SMITH SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN A MEMBER OF THE CULPER SPY RING RESPONSIBLE FOR SIGNALLING BETWEEN AGENTS THE LIFE OF A CHIEF TELLER MUST HAVE SEEMED LIGHT ON DRAMA COMPARED TO THAT AND MAYBE INVESTIGATING TALLMADGE RELIEVED THE BOREDOM THE MORE I THINK ABOUT IT THE MORE CERTAIN I AM THAT THE VAULT IS A COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEM WHAT I DONT KNOW IS WHETHER TALLMADGE WAS PART OF THE SYSTEM OR IF HE WAS JUST INVESTIGATING IT AND IS IT LIVE OR JUST A HISTORIC ARTEFACT IS TALLMADGE A TREASURE HUNTER THE CULPER RING MUST HAVE HAD A FUND TO PAY AGENTS AND I SUPPOSE IT IS NOT IMPOSSIBLE THAT THE LOCATION OF THAT MONEY IS SOMEHOW ENCODED IN THE BOXES OR IS HE USING THE VAULT TO PASS INTELLIGENCE ACROSS A NETWORK IF SO HOW IS HE DOING IT AND IS THIS OFFICIAL OR HAVE WE FOUND OURSELVES A TRAITOR MAYBE WHEN HARRY RESURFACES WE WILL FIND OUT
DESPITE HIS STRANGE DISCOVERY HARPER SEEMS TO HAVE HAD VERY LITTLE INFLUENCE ON THE POLICE INVESTIGATION AT THAT STAGE AND MY INVESTIGATION OF LOCAL FILES SHOWS THAT THE ONLY ACTIVITY IN THE TWO MONTHS FOLLOWING THE DEATH WERE LETTERS EXCHANGED BETWEEN MAISIE ROGERS HARPER AND WHITE ROGERS CONTINUED TO TRY TO QUIETEN THE FUSS WHILE MAISIE INCREASINGLY ANXIOUS ABOUT HER PRECIOUS LIBRARY WORKED HARD TO GET THEM ALL TO TAKE HER CONCERNS SERIOUSLY IN THE END MAISIE SEEMS TO HAVE LOST PATIENCE AND TO HAVE COMMISSIONED HER OWN INVESTIGATION LED BY THE FAMOUS PINKERTON DETECTIVE AGENCY I AM NOT SURE WHY SHE CHOSE THEM ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE COST BUT IT MAY HAVE RELATED TO THEIR ROGUES GALLERY A NATIONAL DATABASE WHICH CONTAINED PHOTOS AND DESCRIPTIONS OF A LARGE NUMBER OF KNOWN AND SUSPECTED CRIMINALS IT WAS THE FIRST OF ITS KIND AND MAISIE MAY HAVE HOPED THAT IT WOULD REVEAL THE IDENTITY OF HER INTERLOPER THE CURRENT LIBRARIAN AT THE MANSION KINDLY GAVE ME ACCESS TO MAISIES PRIVATE RECORDS A SERIES OF DIARIES AND LETTERS MANY OF THEM ENCRYPTED THAT WERE STORED IN THE OFFICE BEHIND THE FIREPLACE IN THE LIBRARY I AM GRADUALLY WORKING THROUGH THEM ALL OR AT LEAST THE ONES THAT SEEM TO BE RELATED TO THIS CASE AND WILL POST ANYTHING RELEVANT FOR STARTERS HERE IS THE REPORT FROM THE PINKERTONS AGENT ASSIGNED TO THE ORIGINAL ENQUIRY I HAVENT HAD A CHANCE TO CRACK THE CIPHER YET SO I DONT KNOW IF THE ROGUES GALLERY PLAYED A ROLE IN THEIR INVESTIGATIONS BUT PERHAPS YOU CAN CHECK THAT FOR ME A QUICK INSPECTION SHOWS THAT THE LETTER FREQUENCIES MATCH THE USUAL DISTRIBUTION PRETTY CLOSELY SUGGESTING THAT THIS WAS NOT ENCRYPTED USING A SUBSTITUTION CIPHER SO YOU WILL NEED TO USE A DIFFERENT APPROACH TO CRACK IT GOOD LUCK HARRY

MR CHARLES BABBAGE DORSET STREET MARYLEBONE LONDON MY DEAR CHARLES, I HOPE THIS LETTER FINDS YOU WELL AND THAT YOUR CAMPAIGN TO CONSIGN THE INFERNAL RACKET OF STREET URCHINS AND THEIR MUSIC TO THE OUTER REACHES OF THE CITY HAS BORNE SOME FRUIT. I AM WRITING TO TELL YOU ABOUT A CURIOUS LETTER THAT I RECEIVED THIS MORNING FROM A WOMAN IN AMERICA. I TOOK NOTE AS SHE HAD TAKEN THE TIME TO ENCRYPT ITS CONTENTS AND HAD INCLUDED A PUZZLE CONSISTING OF A SHORT SEQUENCE OF LETTERS ENGRAVED ON A BULLET. THE CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH THIS BULLET APPEARED ARE NOT FULLY EXPLAINED, BUT HER REQUEST IS THAT WE SHOULD CONSIDER THE ENGRAVING AND ATTEMPT TO DECIPHER ITS MEANING. I SAY WE AND OUR, BUT I MUST ADMIT THAT THE REQUEST WAS DIRECTED TO ME ALONE, POSSIBLY BECAUSE, AS A WOMAN, I MIGHT PAY MORE ATTENTION TO MISS WARNE’S LETTER. IT IS APPARENT FROM THE SCRAWL ON THE PAGE THAT SHE IS NOT HIGHLY EDUCATED, BUT SHE DESCRIBES HERSELF AS A DETECTIVE AND HAD THE WIT TO RECOGNISE THAT THE INSCRIPTION WAS SIGNIFICANT. I THINK I HAVE UNLOCKED ITS SECRET, BUT I WOULD BE PLEASED TO HEAR YOUR THOUGHTS. IN PARTICULAR, IS SHE RIGHT IN HER ASSUMPTION THAT THE LETTERS SIGNIFY SOMETHING TO WHICH WE SHOULD ATTEND? IT SEEMS MORE LIKELY TO ME THAT IT IS MERELY A CURIO. I HAVE MISSED OUR DISCUSSIONS, AND I FLATTER MYSELF THAT YOU ENJOYED THEM TOO. I HOPE THAT THIS CURIOUS BULLET MIGHT GIVE US THE EXCUSE THAT WE NEED TO REINSTATE THEM. PLEASE DO LET ME KNOW YOUR THOUGHTS. YOURS AS ALWAYS, ADA COUNTESS OF LOVELACE
