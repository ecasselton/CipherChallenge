This is a repository of all the scripts I wrote to help me break the ciphers in the National Cipher Challenge.
It also has my solutions to only the 2023 and 2024 Cipher Challenges.

Feel free to take inspiration from my (very messy) code, but remember that it is against the National Cipher Challenge rules to use software and deciphering tools you do not write yourself.
