my dear palmerston, i was reluctant to believe that the mystery of the
silver bullet could defeat the brilliant minds in your office, but i
have come to the conclusion that the singular miss warne was correct
in her assumption that this particular cipher would defeat us. her
choice of the countess as her confident and collaborator was inspired.
the markings on the bullet were clearly significant, though their
meaning escaped me entirely until explained. with that knowledge, the
accompanying letter commands our attention with its dark allusions to
the end of the empire.

i know that you are tempted to ask the two fearsome ladies to step
aside and allow the experts in your department to take on the
investigation, but my own experience of my dear wife suggests that,
once roused, the tigress is unlikely to abandon its meal, and i fear
that we will have to stand aside and allow them to continue on their
adventure. it is clear that they have the skills and determination to
see this through, and i think we will only obstruct them if we
interfere.

i trust that you have reached the same conclusion and that i can ask
babbage to convey our thanks and best wishes to them both, in the hope
that they can bring a speedy resolution to this troubling matter.

yours, albert
