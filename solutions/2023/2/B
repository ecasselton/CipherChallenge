DEAR TOM,

I HESITATE TO WRITE TO YOU AT ALL, THE MATTER BEING SO DELICATE, SO I HOPE YOU WILL UNDERSTAND WHY I HAVE CHOSEN TO ENCIPHER THIS COMMUNICATION. I WOULD NOT WANT TO PLACE YOU IN ANY PERSONAL DIFFICULTY AND AM MINDFUL THAT LETTERS OF THIS KIND ARE EASILY MISUNDERSTOOD.

I HAVE ALREADY DISCUSSED WITH YOU MY HOPE TO SERVE ONE DAY AS GOVERNOR OF OUR HOME STATE. THE RECENT RUMORS THAT BROWN INTENDS TO STEP DOWN TO MAKE A RUN AT THE VICE-PRESIDENCY PRESENT A SIGNIFICANT OPPORTUNITY TO REALISE THAT AMBITION, AND I HAVE BEEN TAKING SOUNDINGS WITH POTENTIAL SUPPORTERS. I HAVE RECEIVED ENCOURAGING FEEDBACK, AND MY PLANS HAVE ADVANCED SOMEWHAT FOLLOWING DISCUSSIONS OVER THE ENDOWMENT FOR THE NEW PROVIDENCE LIBRARY.

I KNOW THAT WE ARE IN AGREEMENT ON THE NEED FOR A STRONG GOVERNOR, AND I AM CONCERNED THAT ANY SCANDAL ASSOCIATED WITH THE STRANGE DEATH OF THE YOUNG MAN IN MY OWN LIBRARY MIGHT TAINT THAT ENDOWMENT AND COULD ULTIMATELY WEAKEN MY CAMPAIGN. YOU WILL UNDERSTAND MY CONCERN.

I AM SURE THERE CANNOT BE ANY MORE DOUBT IN YOUR MIND THAN THERE IS IN MY OWN THAT THE DEATH WAS AN UNFORTUNATE ACCIDENT, AND I HOPE THAT YOU WILL BE ABLE TO PERSUADE YOUR OFFICERS OF THE SAME.

I LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR REPLY.

ROGERS.
